# Mythology Guessing Game 🏛️

A single-player mythology guessing game where players uncover the identities of legendary gods using progressive hints. Each session delivers a fresh, AI-generated puzzle, making every playthrough unique.

This project focuses on **gameplay, UX, and replayability**. The underlying intelligence that generates puzzles is abstracted away so players only interact with a smooth, fun game.

## 🎮 Game Concept

The goal is simple:  
**Guess the god correctly using as few hints as possible.**

Each game session consists of **5 mythology puzzles**, drawn from major world pantheons.

### Supported Pantheons
- Greek  
- Norse  
- Egyptian  
- Hindu  
- Roman  
- Japanese

## 🔁 Core Gameplay Loop

1. Start a new game
2. A mystery god is selected
3. The player is shown:
   - A hint (one at a time)
   - Optional pantheon info (difficulty-based)
4. Player submits a guess
5. If incorrect → another hint is revealed
6. If correct → the god’s identity and lore are shown
7. Move to the next puzzle
8. After 5 gods → game summary screen

## 🧠 Puzzle Generation (Intelligent Contract Integration)

Puzzle content is generated by an **intelligent contract** that:
- Uses AI to create mythology puzzles
- Selects unique gods from approved pantheons
- Produces structured puzzle data:
  - Correct answer
  - Pantheon
  - What the god is known for
  - Three progressive hints

The frontend:
- Requests a new puzzle set at the start of a game
- Reads the generated puzzle data
- Handles all gameplay logic locally (hint reveals, guesses, scoring)

The blockchain layer is **intentionally invisible** to players.

## 🖥️ Frontend Responsibilities

- Parse and validate puzzle data
- Control hint progression
- Handle player guesses
- Display feedback (correct / incorrect)
- Manage game state (current puzzle, attempts, score)
- Provide smooth transitions between puzzles
- Gracefully handle loading and errors

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Daily challenge mode

## 📌 Philosophy

This game is **fun first**.  
AI and blockchain exist only to keep content fresh and unpredictable.

If the player notices the tech, the design failed.
